# Autocorrelation Everywhere

One way to summarize the key challenge this book is meant to address is to ask and answer questions about how we understand, measure, and intervene on epidemiological systems in which *autocorrelation* plays a key role. In the analysis of time-series data, autocorrelation arises all the time: Past measures of an individual or location are often more similar to the present measures at that location than values from another place or person. If the time series is reflective of some process, e.g. infectious disease transmission, its autocorrelation reflcts the way its history influences its present state. 

Autocorrelation is also a central concern of spatial analysis: Legendre [@legendre1993] succinctly defined spatial autocorrelation as "the property of random variables taking values, at pairs of locations a certain distance apart, that are more similar (positive autocorrelation) or less similar (negative autorcorrelation) than expected for *randomly asssociated pairs of observations*[^1]". In the domain of social network analysis, TFL comes into play when we think about the notion of *homophily*, i.e. that "birds of a feather flock together" [@goodreau2009].

## Tobler's First Law

In 1970, the geographer Waldo Tobler coined what is often referred to as Tobler's first law (TFL), which states that "[e]verything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" [@tobler1970]. What Tobler is talking about here is the idea that spatial autocorrelation is ubiquitous in geography. While TFL may sound obvious, Goodchild shows its importance and far-reaching implications through a simple thought ecperiment: 

> "Perhaps the easiest way to see the validity and value of TFL is through a thought experiment, by trying to imagine a world in which it is not true. In such a world, the full range of conditions could be encountered in every minute portion of the world. Every room, for example, might contain the full observed range of the Earthâ€™s topographic variation, from the bottom of the Marianas Trench to the summit of Mount Everest; and the full range of climatic conditions as well. This is the world of white noise, a world that would be impossible to describe, live in, sense, navigate through, or farm." [@goodchild2004]

The notion of the role of 'nearness' and 'farness' in shaping the similarity of outcomes is really the heart of a contextual approach to epidemiology. Tobler was speaking specifically about geographic distance when he made this statement. Specifically, he was referring to the way human populations were distributed in space, and observing that their composition and density were spatially related, with nearby neighborhoods more similar to each other than distant ones. Since Tobler wrote, others have generalized TFL to a more generic notion of nearness or farness across different types of space. 

Applying this idea to a broad array relationships is what it means, at least to me, to do relational or contextual epidemiology. Simply put, this is just the idea that events separated by less time are more likely to be similar - on average - than those separated by longer periods of time. 

#### What does closeness *do*?

Miller [@miller2004] specifically draws on systems theory to argue that the very simple concept of nearness is enough to explain complex geographic phenomena including natural ecosystems and economies, because it is not the nearness that does the 'doing' but that interaction between dynamic components is more likely over short spatial, temporal, or social distances than over longer ones. 

### Similarity is meaningless without variation

- No similarity without variability (i.e. the real first law according to Goodchild [@goodchild2004])

### Why negative autocorrelation matters

## How does autocorrelation manifest in the real world?

### Spatial 

1. Gradients: relatively smooth variability over space, e.g. as a function of elevation in ecological systems [@legendre1993]. According to Legendre, in a true linear gradient the errors at each location are not autocorrelated with each other. 


2. Patchiness: Discreate areas separated by ecological discontinuities or interfaces [@legendre1993].

3. Getis [@getis2010a] discusses how it can be difficult to disentangle local spatial autocorrelation from global, i.e. when there is global autocorrelation we are likely to also find local, so have to be careful about interpreting. 

4. Griffith [@griffith2023a] makes the point that positive and negative spatial autocorrelation commonly co-occur, so that it is important to not over-focus on one vs. the other. 

5. Also points out that the nature of autocorrelation will be a function of scale. Provides the Snow Cholera data as an example: At small scales, there will be a combination of positive (PSA) and negative spatial autocorrelation (NSA), while at higher levels (e.g. all of london) the prevailing pattern will be PSA due to the relatively small size of the area of the outbreak.
